- FIXME: indexfile is generated incorrectly. Correct format is:
    'status' \t 'expiry date' \t 'revocation date' \t 'serial nr' \t 'file' \t 'DN' \n
- FIXME: revocation doesn't work correctly when DN in indexfile contains underscores while in certificate they're spaces
- option to PGP encrypt e-mail
- option to create encrypted zipfile (using 7zip?)
- have CRL patches be included in upstream :)
- if to-be-revoked serial doesn't exist (in indexdb) ask for confirmation
- option to create: openvpn CA cert, empty CRL file, more?
