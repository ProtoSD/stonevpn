BUGS:
- better checking for incorrect openssl.cnf entries. Apparently an empty string ('') is also considered valid.
- don't update indexdb if cert can't be generated (due to missing X509Ext method in pyOpenSSL for example)
- also ask for overwrite clientfile if looking for freeip
- when calculating freeip: don't parse clientfile itself if it exists

NICETOHAVES (in order of priority, first is higher):
- ability to include custom documentation in zipfile and/or attached to mail
- option to PGP encrypt e-mail
- option to use a different configuration file (defaults to /etc/stonevpn.conf)
- have CRL patches be included in upstream :)
- if to-be-revoked serial doesn't exist (in indexdb) ask for confirmation
- option to create encrypted zipfile (using 7zip?)
- option to create: openvpn CA cert
- a web interface would be cool .. in Django! python kicks butt
- log all actions/output
